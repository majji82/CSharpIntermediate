What?

Field is like a variable that we declare at class levl and we store details/data about the class...

Initialization:

public class Customer
{
	List<Order> Orders;
	public Customer()
	{
		Orders = new List<Order>();
	}
}

We can also directly initalize..

public class Customer
{
	List<Order> Orders = new List<Order>();
}

What is readonly?

readonly List<Order> Orders = new List<Order>();

readonly modifier is used to assign the value only once...
Why do we need? To increase safety..
