Property:

It is a class member that encapsulates getter/setter for accesing a field..

Why?

To create getter/setter with less code..

Proprty Syntax:

=> Its dataType is same as the field dataType
=> The name of Property must be in PascalCase

public class Person
{
	private DateTime _birthDate;

	public DateTime Birthdate
	{
		get{return _birthdate; }
		set{_birthdate = value; }
	}
}

Note: Here get and set are C# keywords...

Auto Implemented properties:

public DateTime Birthdate{get; set;}

Note: All the auto-implemented properties must be on the top..
