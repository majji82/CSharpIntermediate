What?

Object Initializer is quickly initializing object without the need to call one of its constructors

Why?

Avoid creating multiple constructors..

public class Person()
{
	public int id;
	public string FirstName;
	public string LastName;
}

Syntax:

var person = new Person
{
	FirstName = "Majji",
	LastName = "Janardhan"
};
