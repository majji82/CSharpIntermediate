What is composition?

Composition is also a kind of relationship between two classes that allows one to contain the other..
It is referred as Has-A relationship

Ex: Car Has-A Engine

Benefits:

- Code re-use
- Flexibility
- Loose coupling

Ex: DBMigrator requires logging
	Installer requires logging
Logging is common...Create a logger 

In UML it is indicated by a diamond sign..

Syntax:

When creating a class sometimes we create private fields..If we need composition then, the related class is the private field in composite class

Ex:

public class Installer
{
	private Logger _logger;

	public Installer(Logger logger)
	{
		this._logger = logger;
	}
}
