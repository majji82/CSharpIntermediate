Class Coupling:

What is coupling?
Coupling is a measure of how interconnected classes and subsystems are..
A software application is composed of many classes that are packaged under various namespaces and assemblys

Ex:
If Class B and F are dependent on class A, if we need to change class A then there may be a chance that we need to change class B and F also..Similarly dependency of classes affects the application if there need to be a change in one of the class...
	This is an example of tightly coupled class..which means if one class changes then most of the code in the application is affected..

In contrast to tight coupling we have loose coupling..The idea is if we make changes in a class the changes must be isolated..This must not affect other parts of application..

How?
=> Encapsulation
=> Relationship between classes
=> Interfaces

Relationship between classes:

=> Inheritence
=> Composition
