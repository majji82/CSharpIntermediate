What is inheritance?

Inheritance is a kind of relationship between two classes which allow one to inherit code from the other..
Referred to as	[Is-A] relationship..

Ex: A car Is-A vehicle

Benifits:

Code re-use [Encapsulate some common code in one class and reuse in other classes]
PolyMorphic Behaviour

Write Code once => reuse it in multiple contexts..
