Method Overriding
Virtual and override keywords

Method Overriding:
	It is used to modify the implementation of an inherited method...

Note:
	Method overloading has the method with same name but different signatures...Over riding is about changing the implementation of an inherited method...

Ex:

public class Shape
{
	public void Draw()
	{
		// code
	}
}

public class Circle: Shape
{
	// code
}

public class Image: Shape
{
	// code
}

Here the algo for drawing a circle and image is different..Hence we need to change the implementation of the Draw() method..
For changing this we use virtual and override keywords..

public class Shape
{
	public virtual void Draw()
	{
		// Default implementation
	}
}

public class Circle : Shape
{
	public override void Draw()
	{
		// new implementation..
	}
}

We use virtual keyword in the parent/base class and override keyword in the derived class..
This is one way of achieving polymorphism..
